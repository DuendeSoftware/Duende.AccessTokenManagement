## About Duende.AccessTokenManagement

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This project is now managed in our [FOSS repository](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/foss/tree/main/access-token-management).

This is the repository for a set of .NET libraries that manage OAuth and OpenId
Connect access tokens. These tools automatically acquire new tokens when old
tokens are about to expire, provide conveniences for using the current token
with HTTP clients, and can revoke tokens that are no longer needed.

## Packages
The libraries in this repository are distributed as NuGet packages.

- [Duende.AccessTokenManagement](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Duende.AccessTokenManagement) manages tokens acquired in machine-to-machine flows in 
[.NET workers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/workers) and [ASP.NET Core worker services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/hosted-services).
- [Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect)
manages tokens acquired in user-centric flows in [ASP.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet)
applications.
